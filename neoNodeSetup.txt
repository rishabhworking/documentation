Download the Neo-cli debian package from the github. Also install the dependencies.

https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/exchange/general.html

launch neo cli with:
./neo-cli

Then install all plugins by:
install <plugin name>

After doing this a new folder will be created by the name of "Plugins", All you need to do is to move all plugins from their respoective folder to the Plugins Directory:

cd Plugins
cp RpcSystemAssetTracker/Plugins/RpcSystemAssetTracker.dll .
cp RpcSecurity/Plugins/RpcSecurity.dll .
cp RpcNep5Tracker/Plugins/RpcNep5Tracker.dll .
And so on ......

To Enable the RPC run the following command with nohup:

dotnet neo-cli.dll /rpc (Startin the neo-cli daemon with the RPC enabled)
sudo nohup dotnet neo-cli.dll /rpc > /dev/null 2>&1 &

Configure the RPC from config.json in the same directory as the neo-cli.

Step 1. Create a hidden directory in home foler:

nano /home/ubuntu/.neo

Step 2. Open the neo-cli and create a wallet with command:
create wallet <path>
Ex: create wallet /home/ubuntu/.neo/Xbond_Neo_wallet.db3
(You can keep the extension of the wallet wither db3 or json)

You will be asked to set a password for the created wallet and same password would be used further.

Step 3. Now place the wallet path and the password in config.json. Also set the "IsActive" option to true.
Ex:
    "UnlockWallet": {
      "Path": "/home/ubuntu/.neo/Xbond_Neo_wallet.db3",
      "Password": "adminpc",
      "StartConsensus": false,
      "IsActive": true
    },

Step 4. Also configure the RPC port and the IP to be binded.
    "RPC": {
      "BindAddress": "127.0.0.1",
      "Port": 10332,
      "SslCert": "",
      "SslCertPassword": ""
    },

Step 5. Install the "screen" and run the neo-cli as a dameon as I wasn't able to do so with nohup.
Inside neo-cli directory 
Run: sudo screen ./neo-cli /rpc

The dameon was not able to sync beyond a point. Due to this error: https://github.com/neo-project/neo-cli/issues/434
Note: Install the plugins in correct format. 

Also download the blockchain copy from https://sync.ngd.network/ and simple put it into the neo-cli directory. The neo-cli will automatically sync the blocks.
