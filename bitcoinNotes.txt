Mining is used to prevent double spending of btc.

How double Spend is stopped:
1. Rather than writng directly to the chain, nodes store transactions in a memory pool.
Each BTC Node on network is allocated a small temp-memory known as Mempool.

Now say we have two transactions spending same btc, half nodes has transaction A and half nodes has transaction B.
Now all the nodes will try to write(add) that transaction to the blockchain.

Condition 1: Suppose one node was successfully able to add the trasaction to chain (and it was transcation A). Now other nodes will accept it and transaction B will be rejected.

Condition 2: As BTC network is quite big, suppose both transaction A and B were mined by some two differnt distant nodes and added to blockchain. In this case the transaction with more confirmations will be added and other one will be rejected.
NOTE: At same time their can be many differnt copies of blockchain with minor changes, these are sorted out by number of confirmations or more node
