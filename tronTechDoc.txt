Address Prefix: X
Supply Changes: 50,000,000
Reward Changes: Custom (Both Vote/Candidate Reward and Super Representative Reward)
Number of Top Super Representatives Candidates and Super Representatives. (Currently Top Super Representatives Candidates = 127, Super Representatives = 27)

Precation: "SuperRepresentatives Candidates", "Top SuperRepresentatives Candidates" and "SuperRepresentatives" are different.

"SuperRepresentatives Candidates" = Any interger N.
"Top SuperRepresentatives Candidates"= Top 127 out of N.
"SuperRepresentatives" = Top 27 out of 127.

1. Anyone can create a Tron account and apply for the SuperRepresentative. When applying, 9999 TRX will be burned from the applicant’s account. Once successful, such account can join the SR election.
Find out: Who will approve this application, whole network or any/some specific node/s?
Find out: How these 9999 TRX are burned. Generally Burning means send amount to an address whose private key can't be obtained.

2. Once You are SuperRepresentative, any other account or you yourself can vote for you.
Note: TRON Power (denoted as TP) is needed to vote and the amount of TP depends on the voter’sfrozen assets (TRX). TP is calculated in the following way:
'1 TP  = 1 TRX frozen to get bandwidth'
Note: You can't unfreeze the TP for next 3 days. Once you unfreeze your TRX, the votes you gave will be removed too. 

3. There can be any number of "SuperRepresentatives Candidates". At moment there are 238 "SuperRepresentatives Candidates" in Tron network.

4. Twist:
Only 127 out of these 238 are valuable. The 'Candiate Reward' is shared between top 127 "SuperRepresentatives Candidates".
Only 27 out of above 127 are "SuperRepresentatives". The 'Super Representative Reward' is shared between these 27 representatives.
People can continuously vote, the ranking changes every round where 1 Round = 6 hours that is four times a day.

5. Reward Distribution:

Vote Reward/Candidate Reward: This reward is distributed every round, 1 Round = 6 hours among the "Top SuperRepresentatives Candidates"(top 127).
Reward: 16 TRX per block.
Reward Each Round: 16 × 20 × 60 × 6 = 115,200 TRX
Reward Each Year: 16 × 20 × 60 × 24 × 365 = 168,192,000 TRX
The reward will be split in accordance with the vote weighteach candidate receives.

Block Reward/Super Representative Reward: This reward is also distributed every round, 1 Round = 6 hours among the "SuperRepresentatives"(top 27).
Reward: 32 TRX per block.
Reward Each Round: 32 × 20 × 60 × 6 = 230,400 TRX
Reward Each Year: 32 × 20 × 60 × 24 × 365 = 336,384,000 TRX

Total Rewards:

SR Reward Calculation:
----------------------
[total reward = vote reward (VR) + block reward (BR)]

VR = total VR × votes SR candidate received/total votes
BR = total BR/27 - block missed × 32

Note: the reward is calculated per SR per round (6 hours)

Rank 28 to rank 127 SR candidate reward calculation:
----------------------------------------------------
[total reward = vote reward (VR)]

VR = total VR × votes SR candidate received/total votes
	
Note: the reward is calculated per SR candidate per round (6 hours)

Challenge 1: We will have to find a new reward structure as current reward system is for 99 Billion Supply. If we go with this supply it will run only for around 12 days. 

Challenge 2: We will have to reduce the number of "SuperRepresentatives Candidates" and "SuperRepresentatives".


# Network Changes
==========================

Removal of existing nodes: Full Nodes, Witness Nodes and Solidity Nodes.
Addition of new nodes in place of above ones.
Genesis block.
Block generation in new chain.

Note: Please checkout the Tron Whitepaper it has variable names and other description too.
