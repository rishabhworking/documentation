The main difference is that sshd is a server (like a web server serving https) and SSH is a client (think of a web browser).
The client/user authenticates itself against the server using the users credentials.

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

systemctl restart sshd
(after every change in ssh config)

PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
The Challenge one should be removed

New ubutnu versions make you to change here at: /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf
