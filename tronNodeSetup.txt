
1. Download JDK 1.8 

https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html

( I have downloaded jdk-8u261-linux-x64.tar.gz for ubuntu 16.04 x64)


2. Make a directory for the JDK:

sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/jvm


3. Extract the tarball and install the JDK:

sudo tar zxvf jdk-version-linux-x64.tar.gz -C /usr/lib/jvm
(sudo tar zxvf jdk-8u261-linux-x64.tar.gz -C /usr/lib/jvm)


4. Tell the system that there's a new Java version available:

sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_version/bin/java" 1
(sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_261/bin/java" 1)


5. Set the new JDK as the default:

sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_version/bin/java
(sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_261/bin/java)


6. Verify the version of the JRE or JDK

java -version

java version "1.8.0_261"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_261-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.261-b12, mixed mode)


7. Download latest Binaries from the github

https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/releases
(Download the FullNode.jar)


8. Download the copy of latest chain for faster Sync

https://backup.trongrid.io
(Download from Europe server as it happens to be fater than the Asia server. Download will take hours depending on internet speed)


9. Extract the chain

Example: tar -xzvf FullNode-25767489-4.1.1-output-directory.tgz
(run it in background with screen as it will take hours as the tar is large in size)


10. Create a script to safely stop the node

Create a script by name of stopFullNode.sh and put the following content in it:

#!/bin/bash
while true; do
  pid=`ps -ef |grep FullNode.jar |grep -v grep |awk '{print $2}'`
  if [ -n "$pid" ]; then
    kill -15 $pid
    echo "The java-tron process is exiting, it may take some time, forcing the exit may cause damage to the database, please wait patiently..."
    sleep 1
  else
    echo "java-tron killed successfully!"
    break
  fi
done


11. Run the node 

screen java -jar FullNode.jar
(it will run the node in the background and pick the blocks from the extracted data directory)


12. Access the API on port 8090

Now the api will be open at Your_IP:8090 

Example: 198.162.1.1:8090

Example: curl http://198.162.1.1:8090/wallet/getnowblock

!! Important !! 

The Tron Full Node never stores your private keys in the server, it send them to you when you generate an address. Please store the private keys properly in your own database, don'r forget backups.

Note: IF YOU EVER NEED TO STOP THE FULL NODE, STOP IT SAFELY BY RUNNING STOP SCRIPT IN STEP 10 (sh stopFullNode.sh)
Note: Encrypt your connection with SSL
