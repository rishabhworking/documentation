** Refer Official Documentation at: https://github.com/xun-project/UltraNote/blob/master/doc/paymentgate.md
** All the commands were run in the same directory where bianries were extracted (I used C:\Users\ilove\Downloads\UltraNoteWallet-CLI-1.0.13\)

1. Download the ultranote binaries from: https://ultranote.org/UltraNoteWallet-CLI-1.0.13.zip
2. Unzip them at desired location. (I did at C:\Users\ilove\Downloads\UltraNoteWallet-CLI-1.0.13)
3. Create a configuration file paymentgate.conf (or whatever name you like but you'll need to change it at each instance then)
4. Now edit the configuration file, and put atleast the minimal configuration required. You can add other fields like rpc-user & rpc-password.

I created the configuration file at the same location where I extracted binaries: C:\Users\ilove\Downloads\UltraNoteWallet-CLI-1.0.13\

It is minimal confiuration:

		container-file=C:\Users\ilove\Downloads\UltraNoteWallet-CLI-1.0.13\container.iwallet
		bind-port=8070
		bind-address=127.0.0.1
		container-password=sectet123
		log-file=C:\Users\ilove\Downloads\UltraNoteWallet-CLI-1.0.13\walletd.log
		local=1

Available configuration options:

		container-file=	            # REQUIRED. Path to wallet container
		container-password= 	    # REQUIRED. Password
		data-dir=/srv/ultranote	    # Where blockchain data is stored. Defaults to /home/user/.UltraNote
		bind-address=0.0.0.0	    # Use server IP or 127.0.0.1
		bind-port=8070		    # Port
		rpc-user=                   # Auth user for RPC service
		rpc-password=               # Password for RPC service
		server-root=/srv/ultranote  # Working directory
		log-level=                  # Log level 0-4
		local=1                     # Use In-process node
		daemon-address=localhost    # remote daemon address, don't use it with in-process mode
		daemon-port=30000           # 

5. Now generate the wallet container (a file which will store all addresses and their respecitve public and private keys). This is the command: 

walletd --config=paymentgate.conf --generate-container

If everythig goes well you will be greeted by such output:

		2019-Apr-06 14:34:29.662425 INFO [main] PaymentService  v1.0.13.ultra0013(0.1-g72946d9)
		2019-Apr-06 14:34:29.662425 INFO [generateNewWallet] Generating new wallet
		2019-Apr-06 14:34:29.662425 INFO [generateNewWallet] New wallet is generated. Address: Xun3rz8XavB8jXajXpguk9YavGXkFo4TajS2GhLNdFAtFsm6a5yx8frF2oQYBnLXNPZPh4Zjq5e82M9ED3fpDWyG5CxgSpngym
		2019-Apr-06 14:34:29.693681 INFO [generateNewWallet] Wallet is saved

6. Now comes the last step, which is to run the walletd service using following command: 

walletd --config=paymentgate.conf

7. Congrats!! you have a running CLI wallet for ultranote.
